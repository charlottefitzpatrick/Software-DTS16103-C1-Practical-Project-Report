This is the repository for my software assignment game.
This code allos the game 'snake' to be played in python.

-Code Description- 
When the code is run, Pygame will open in a seperate window so the player can start the game 'snake'. The player must use the 'WASD' keys to move the snake into the food object to grow the snake. The player looses the game if the snakes body hits itself.
